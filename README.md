# Driver_fatigue_system 
1. Introduction
   
Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road accidents. Fatigue Detection utilizes
MediaPipe’s Face Mesh and vision-based indicators—Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), yawning
frequency, and posture—to detect early signs of drowsiness and issue timely alerts.

2. Objectives

  Implement MediaPipe Face Mesh for real-time facial landmark detection,
  Compute EAR to monitor prolonged eye closure,
  Detects yawning via lip aperture analysis,
  Estimate gaze direction to assess driver attentiveness,
  Issue audio/visual alerts when fatigue indicators are met,
