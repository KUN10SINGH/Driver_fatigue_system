# Driver_fatigue_system
1. Introduction
   
Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road accidents. Fatigue Detection utilizes
MediaPipe’s Face Mesh and vision-based indicators—Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), yawning
frequency, and posture—to detect early signs of drowsiness and issue timely alerts.

2. Objectives

 1. Implement MediaPipe Face Mesh for real-time facial landmark detection.
 2. Compute EAR to monitor prolonged eye closure.
 3. Detects yawning via lip aperture analysis.
 4. Estimate gaze direction to assess driver attentiveness.
 5. Issue audio/visual alerts when fatigue indicators are met.
